# Korean Notes

  Welcome to the section of my site dedicated to learning the Korean
  language, grammar, vocabulary, and culture. While this section is 
  mostly separate from the rest of my notes, which focus on programming
  and computer science, it will be interesting to see what connections
  develop over time. By continuously revisiting and refining these
  notes, this practice not only documents my progress in Korean language
  study but also reinforces prior knowledge, fostering deeper 
  understanding as diverse areas potentially intersect.
