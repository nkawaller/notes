# Intuitive Definition of a Limit 

  > e.g. 'approximating the slope of the tangent line' or 'approximating 
  > the derivative'

  Say you have a parabola, and you choose an arbitrary point on it 
  (let's use `P(1, 4)` as an example). If we wanted to find the slope of 
  the tangent line at that exact point, we would need one other point to
  calculate `∆y / ∆x`, which is the slope formula.

  Because we don't have another point on the tangent line, we'll instead
  pick a second point `Q` on the parabola that's very close to `P`. When 
  we calculate the slope using `P` and `Q`, we get the slope of a secant 
  line connecting the two points.

  If we repeat this process and choose points `Q` that are closer and
  closer to `P`, the slope of the secant line gets closer and closer to
  the slope of the tangent line at `P`.

  As `Q` gets closer and closer to `P`, the slope of the secant lines
  approach a specific value. This value is called the limit, and it
  represents the slope of the tangent line at `P`.
