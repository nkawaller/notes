# 학교 가는 길

  “얼른 일어나야지!”
  더 자고 싶었지만,
  기지개를 쭉 펴고 나서 벌떡 일어났어요.
  
  > "I have to get up early!"
  > Even though she wanted to sleep more,
  > she stretched out her arms, got up, and quickly got out of bed.
  
  양치질과 세수를 하고
  머리를 빗고 옷을 갈아입고,
  아침밥을 맛있게 먹었어요.
  
  > She brushed her teeth and washed her face,
  > combed her hair and changed her clothes,
  > then ate a delicious breakfast.
  
  알림장을 펴고 준비물을 챙겼어요.
  “학교 다녀오겠습니다.”
  아빠한테 인사를 하고 현관문을 나섰어요.
  
  > She opened her notebook and packed her supplies.
  > "I’m off to school."
  > She greeted her dad and stepped out the front door.
  
  정원의 개나리꽃을 보며 인사했어요.
  “학교 갔다 올게.”
  너무 아쉬웠지만, 꽃길을 따라 걸어갔어요.
  
  > She greeted the forsythia flowers in the garden.
  > "I’ll be back from school."
  > Although she felt sad, she walked along the flower path.
  
  앞집 할머니와 강아지 만두가 보여요.
  “안녕하세요, 할머니.”
  “얼른 가야지. 학교 늦겠다.”
  “네, 다녀오겠습니다. 만두야 갔다 올게.”
  
  > She saw the grandmother next door and her dog, Mandu.
  > "Hello, Grandma."
  > "You’d better hurry. You’ll be late for school."
  > "Yes, I’m off. See you later, Mandu."
  
  큰길로 나가 차들이 쌩쌩 달리는 네거리에 닿았어요.
  녹색 어머니 당번인 현주 엄마를 만났어요.
  “안녕하세요, 아줌마!”
  
  > She reached a busy intersection where cars zoomed by.
  > She met Hyunju’s mom, who was on duty as a crossing guard.
  > "Hello, ma’am!"
  
  파란 신호등이 켜지자,
  아줌마가 웃으며 호루라기를 불었어요.
  앞을 잘 보고,
  장난도 안 치고, 얼른 횡단보도를 건넜어요.
  
  > When the green light turned on,
  > the lady smiled and blew her whistle.
  > She looked ahead carefully,
  > didn't play around, and quickly crossed the crosswalk.
  
  교문에 나와 계신 학교 보안관 아저씨께 인사했어요.
  “안녕하세요?”
  정글짐 옆을 지나 운동장을 가로질러서 학교 안으로 들어가요.
  
  > She greeted the school security guard standing by the gate.
  > "Hello?"
  > She passed by the jungle gym and crossed the playground to go into the school.
  
  교실에 들어서며
  친구들에게 인사해요.
  “얘들아, 안녕?”
  
  > As she entered the classroom,
  > she greeted her friends.
  > "Hi, everyone!"
