  Welcome to my website. It's a digital garden[^1], which is a bit 
  different from the conventional blog format. Here, instead of polished 
  articles or a structured index, you'll discover a living collection of 
  evolving ideas and early-stage explorations. This space serves as a 
  personal thinking environment, fostering the ongoing development and 
  refinement of concepts.

  Without traditional navigation aids, this site encourages casual 
  browsing by allowing you to follow links from one note to another and
  stumble upon insights in their raw, formative stages. This dynamic 
  environment represents an ongoing process of learning and intellectual 
  growth, where ideas are revisited, rethought, and expanded over time.
