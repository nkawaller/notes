  Welcome to my website. It's a digital garden, which is a bit different
  from the conventional blog format. Here, instead of polished articles
  or a structured index you'll discover a living collection of evolving
  ideas and early-stage explorations. This space serves as a personal
  thinking environment, fostering the ongoing development and refinement
  of concepts.

  Without traditional navigation aids, this site encourages unstructured
  exploration. You're invited to stumble upon insights in their raw,
  formative stages. This dynamic environment represents a continuous
  journey of learning and intellectual growth, where ideas are 
  revisited, rethought, and expanded over time.
